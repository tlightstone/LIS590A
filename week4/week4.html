                        As this is the 4th week of my internship, I’m finally getting into the swing of things. I have a lot of work to do, so I was able to become self sufficient in delegating my own tasks and determining task management skills. My goal for the week was to finish the book collection move as well as really get into the Latrobe technical reports that I need to digitize, process, and catalog.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I felt independent choosing when to digitize, catalog and move books. Being able to set my own pace allowed me freedom to accomplish the tasks that I was the most productive in at the time. This showed through my work as I finished the book collection move by Thursday of this week. Another tasked marked off.
                    </p>

                        I feel we were a bit ambitious in our learning outcomes for this summer quarter, as the quarter is only 2 months long, but my internship is 3.5 months long. The judgement of was mis-predicted, but it does feel good to accomplish a 2nd goal.
                    </p>

                    <p>

As part of my intern requirements, I was to make a PowerPoint presentation of about 3-5 minutes on a topic of my choice and present it. I chose the topic of library science and this helped me practice my public speaking skills. I really enjoy Carpenter’s care in making sure the interns learn useful skills for their future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I digitized an entire box of Latrobe technical documents, and got most of them processed this week! Photo for reference. Although I still have to catalog them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this was a really productive week that taught me a lot of new skills.
