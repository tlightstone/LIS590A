                        This was a very “normal” week. I’m happy to say that things are feeling normal now. I know what is expected for me to do at work and the tasks that I need to accomplish. Much of this week included digitization and cataloging of publications and Latrobe Technical Reports.

                        A new skill I learned this week was how to discard a physical book and how to delete the record from the accession list and from Presto. This process requires physically processing the book by crossing out property stamps, barcode numbers, and adding the discard date to the accession list. The books then are moved to the free books cart for employees to take if they desire. If books are not taken after a while, they are brought to a book recycling facility that turns them into animal bedding. These were the physical books I thought should be discarded from my book collection move that I previously finished. I discarded 61 books.

                        We also accomplished the midterm survey report. Together, my boss, Mindy, and I discussed my progress toward my learning outcome goals. We determined that I’m right on track for my internship. However, my internship halfway mark is at the first week of August. As such, I may not accomplish all the learning outcome goals by the time that this class ends, as we were judging the timing for 14 weeks, not 10 weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have really been enjoying my time here this summer, and I am excited for the weeks to come.
