                    <p>
                        This week my boss was on vacation, so it was time to take what I had learned in week one and get work done. My main goals for the week were to get started on the book collection move and get a good chunk of cataloging the Latrobe Government Reports.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The other librarian at Carpenter was helping me throughout the week, answering any questions that I had and helping me along, so I wasn’t completely along. Additionally, this was the first week I was beginning my hybrid work, working at home on Tuesday and Friday, although starting the following week I will only be working from home on Fridays.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To define this goal of the book collection move. The library holds 10 stacks of physical books that were misplaced when the carpet was redone in the past. My job is to move all the books in the correct order based on the Dewey Decimal System. I managed to move 1.5 stacks this week, which took me about 6 hours to do. This work is slow, because I also go through each book and select any that I believe should be weeded from the collection. From the 1.5 stacks, I pulled 7 books to be weeded, which will or will not be approved when my boss gets back next week. (although spoiler: they all got weeded! Yay!) This work is also tiring so I can only do about 2 hours of it before I need to take  decent sized break.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, during the week, I finished getting all the Latrobe Governmental Reports either digitally, and physically cataloged about 15 of them. Governmental reports are usually published freely by the government, so I try my best to find the digital copy online to catalog into Presto (Carpenter’s knowledge repository) or I physically catalog it into the collection. These digital copies I then save for my WFH days. On my WFH days, I used Adobe Acrobat to scan and OCR the documents so that they are full-text searchable in Presto, then I cataloged all of them into Presto to make them available. I cataloged 55 digital items this week.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From the work this week, I learned a lot about how a specialized library works. When physically cataloging, since we use the DDC, we end up getting into the weeds of the numbers. For example, there are many that use the call number 620.17.. So, we have to use the Cutter system to make the call numbers even more unique. Also, I learned the importance of keeping things in the same format when cataloging in the Presto system. This allows searching by subject, author, and date more easily by the user.
