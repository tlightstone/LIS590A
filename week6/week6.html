                        As I am approaching the middle of my internship at Carpenter, I am fully focused on digitizing and cataloging the Latrobe Technical Reports. I have familiarity with these because I am on the 2nd and 3rd box and have a good understanding of how to digitize and catalog them well. So, for much of my time this week, that is what I did. As I have been doing a couple of them, I’ve noticed that some reports have connections to other reports, usually referencing them in the abstracts or by name. This is important new information that I need to be aware of when cataloging because I have to ability to connect these reports directly in the listing on our knowledge management site, Presto. Other than that, I just must be aware of not making spelling mistakes or typos when entering the information into the catalog.                    <p>
                    </p>

                        Also, this week, I took a stab at the archives, or the room at Carpenter where historical documents and objects are boxed up. My goal this summer is not to make the archives searchable or perfectly usable, but to organize and condense documents and items into better sections so that someone in the future had an easier time making it usable. It is really dusty and dirty, but I got to see a lot of cool items. There are big old reels of film, old photography, obituaries from the 1940s, and other cool stuff.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Friday, it is the first day of intern presentations, done by other interns who are ending their internships this week. I got to see what is expected of me at the end of my internship as well as what other interns are doing around the company. It was very insightful.                    </p>
