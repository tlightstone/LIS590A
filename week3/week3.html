                    <p>
                        This week was only a 3 day work week because of the July 4th holiday.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Monday, I learned a new format of cataloging – publications. These include documents that have been published by Carpenter employees as paper, conferences and more. I also learned how to scan documents so that I can make physical documents digital and then how to process them in Adobe Acrobat so that they look nice and are full-text searchable in our online knowledge management system -- Presto. Learning how to catalog different forms of documents is a really important skill. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Tuesday and Wednesday, I did more of the book collection move and learned a third format of cataloging – technical reports. The largest job for me this summer is to go through at least 8 boxes of Latrobe technical reports, digitizing them and cataloging them into Presto. These are a lot more difficult to catalog. Latrobe is a different steel company that was acquired by Carpenter. These documents are from the 1960s-1980s of all their research and projects conducted. Since they were a different company, how they organized and labeled their documents was in a completely different system than Carpenters were. So, there was discussion with my boss on how to properly get these cataloged and what needs to be kept or destroyed. I’m glad to be part of the decision making process and have my opinions heard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I’ve started on collating the book publication dates so that they are all in the same format. This is a task I came up with on my own after using Presto for a bit and thinking this needed some improvement. This is really exciting for me because I really love making things more organized and usable. This task isn’t a priority, but it’s for whenever I need a break from some of my other more important work.
                    </p>
